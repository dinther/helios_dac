# helios_dac.js
Implementation of the Helios DAC sdk using webUSB.
The Helios DAC from [Bitlasers](https://bitlasers.com/helios-laser-dac/) is a pretty capable open source DAC. It connects to any show laser via the standard ILDA interface and is controlled via USB.
This means that my Beatline show laser software can drive the laser directly from the browser.

Don't get excited, it's not working yet but I am confident it will get there.
